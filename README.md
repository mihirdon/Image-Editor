Video of my image editor displaying the mosaic function and sharpen image function. There are many more features unable to be featured here because of github's video size limit.

- ## Mosaic Filter: (Shown)
Splits the image into groups of similar colored "tiles", the number of which is defined by the user

- ## Sharpen Filter: (Shown)
Sharpens the features of the image

- ## Blur Filter:
Blurs the features of the image

- ## Downsize Filter:
Reduces the height and width of the image to the size in pixels as specified by the user

- ## Monochrome Filter:
Makes the image black and white

- ## Sepia Filter:
Makes the image look "older" by browning all of the colors in the image

- ## Invisible Filter:
Makes the image invisible, allowing it to display the image behind this image (images uploaded previously) or white if there are not any

- ## Visible Filter:
Makes the image visible, thus hiding the images behind it

- ## Checkerboard:
Makes an image of a checkerboard with its length in number of board tiles and its width in number of board tiles
